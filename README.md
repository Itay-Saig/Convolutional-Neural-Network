# Convolutional-Neural-Network
Building a Convolutional Neural Network model for visual image analysis. Classification of images into two classes: 'with sunglasses', and 'without sunglasses'.

In this notebook, the following steps are performed:

1. Using CNN in order to classify images into two classes: 'sunglasses', and 'without sunglasses'.
2. Preprocessing: transforming and scaling the data.
3. Searching for optimal hyperparameters.
4. Creating a CNN and training the model.
5. Evaluating the model using Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve and Learning Curve.

The notebook is based on 'FACES' dataset, and was developed using Python.
