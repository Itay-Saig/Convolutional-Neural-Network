# Convolutional-Neural-Network
Using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to help analyze visual images. Classification of images into two classes: 'with sunglasses', and 'without sunglasses'.

In this Notebook, I will perform:
1. Using CNN in order to classify images into two classes: 'sunglasses', and 'without sunglasses'.
2. Preprocessing: transforming and scaling the data.
3. Searching for optimal hyperparameters.
4. Creating CNN and train the model.
5. Evaluating the model using Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve and Learning Curve.

This notebook based on 'FACES' dataset.
